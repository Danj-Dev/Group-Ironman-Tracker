- Quest completion tracking
- Achievement diary completion tracking

## How To Use

1. Install and enable the plugin in RuneLite.
2. Log into the account you want to track.
3. Open the `Group Ironman Tracker` side panel.
4. If you are creating a new group, click `+`.
5. If you are joining an existing group, click `J` and enter the group auth code.
6. Click `C` to view the current group auth code for sharing.
7. Click `M` to view current group members.
8. Click `-` to leave the current group.

The panel will automatically show recent shared activity once you are in a group.

## Tech Stack

- Java
- RuneLite Plugin API
- Gradle
- Spring Boot backend
- PostgreSQL through Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS)
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## External Sync

This plugin uses an external backend to persist and sync group activity between players in the same group.

That allows:
- multiple accounts to join the same group
- shared recent activity across different machines
- persistent group history between sessions

## Data & Privacy

Group Ironman Tracker sends only the data needed to create groups, authenticate group members, and sync tracked activity. This includes in-game player names, group auth codes, session tokens, timestamps, and tracked event details such as levels, drops, quests, diaries, combat tasks, collection log unlocks, and boss kill counts.

The plugin does not intentionally collect or submit player IP addresses in its event payloads. Like any service hosted behind AWS or a web server, connection metadata such as source IP addresses may appear in standard infrastructure or access logs depending on backend logging configuration.

Group data is stored in AWS-backed services and is scoped to the group auth/session flow used by the plugin.

## Notes

- Group membership is authorized by a shared group auth code.
- Normal requests use a stored session token after join/create.
- Group auth code and session token are stored internally by the plugin and are not intended to be edited in config.
- The plugin syncs recent activity automatically while logged in.
